A Rust implementation of a [tar pit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_(networking))

## Attributions

I discovered the idea from and attribute the algorithm to Chris Wellons, https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/03/22/. The original program is implemented in Python with asyncio. My goals with this project are to implement the server in Rust, and extend the program with Prometheus-based metrics.
